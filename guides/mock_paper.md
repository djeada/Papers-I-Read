### **Abstract**
*The **Abstract** is a brief summary of the entire paper. It typically states the main objective, methods, and key results or conclusions.*

We propose a new metric, called **TRANSFORM-X**, to estimate how effectively a model trained on one domain can be adapted to another. Our approach relies on a single forward pass over the target data, avoiding expensive retraining procedures. The resulting metric correlates strongly with final task accuracy across a range of benchmarks, including text classification, image recognition, and time-series analysis. Experiments show that **TRANSFORM-X** outperforms existing baselines by up to 15% in correlation with actual transfer performance, highlighting its ability to capture both network capacity and domain difficulty.

## **1. Introduction**
*The **Introduction** provides context for the problem, explains why it is important, and sets up the overarching narrative for the paper.*

When transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain, it is important to estimate in advance how beneficial such a transfer will be. Recent literature has emphasized the cost of fully retraining or fine-tuning large models, especially as datasets become more complex and specialized. 

Despite improvements in **transfer learning algorithms**, selecting the right source model remains a challenge. Most traditional approaches rely on large-scale experiments, making the selection process computationally intensive. This motivates the need for a quick and reliable metric to guide practitioners in choosing the best source model.

## **2. General Problem Definition**
*The **Problem Definition** (or related section) explicitly states the research question or task. It often frames the scope and boundaries of the problem.*

In essence, **transferability** estimation aims to predict how well knowledge from a model trained on one labeled dataset (the source) will generalize to a different dataset (the target). Formally:

- We have a source domain \(\mathcal{D}_S\) consisting of labeled data \(\{(x^S_i, y^S_i)\}\).  
- We aim to transfer to a target domain \(\mathcal{D}_T\) with labeled data \(\{(x^T_j, y^T_j)\}\).  
- We denote a pre-trained modelâ€™s feature extractor by \(f_\theta\), and a subsequent classifier by \(g_\phi\).  

Measuring **transferability** often requires retraining \(g_\phi\) on top of the extracted features \(f_\theta(x^T)\). Our goal is to estimate how well \(g_\phi\) can perform *without* performing this full re-training step.

### **2.1 Gap: Limitations of Existing Metrics**
*This section identifies gaps or weaknesses in past solutions, guiding the reader toward the novel contribution.*

Existing transferability metrics either:
1. Require **fine-tuning** or **retraining** on the target task, which can be computationally costly.  
2. Make assumptions about **data distribution**, restricting applicability to scenarios where source and target domains share similar characteristics.

Hence, there remains a need for a simple, interpretable method that can be computed with minimal overhead.

---

### **2.2 Proposed Solution**
*After discussing the gap, here we introduce our **main contribution** (TRANSFORM-X).*

We introduce **TRANSFORM-X**, a novel metric that:
- Leverages **sample-level likelihood estimates** to gauge how the pretrained features align with the target data distribution.
- Avoids **costly parameter optimization** on the target domain by using a **shallow alignment technique** that requires only one pass over the target data.
- Provides an **interpretation** of transferability akin to a **log-likelihood** measure, with desirable theoretical properties.

## **3. Method**
*The **Method** section describes how the proposed solution works in detail, often including theoretical formulations, diagrams, or pseudo-code.*

Our method comprises the following key components:

1. **Feature Extraction**  
   *We first describe how we obtain feature representations from our source-trained model.*  
   Given a pretrained feature extractor \(f_\theta\), we pass each target sample \(x^T_j\) through \(f_\theta\) to obtain features \(\mathbf{z}_j = f_\theta(x^T_j)\).

2. **Distribution Alignment**  
   *Next, we align feature embeddings from the target domain with source-class prototypes.*  
   We compute an empirical conditional distribution of target labels, \(p(y \mid \mathbf{z}_j)\), by weighting predictions over source-class prototypes. Each source-class prototype can be computed as the mean embedding of source domain samples sharing the same label.

3. **TRANSFORM-X Metric Computation**  
   *Finally, we combine the above steps into a single scalar metric.*  
   Using the distribution alignment, the **TRANSFORM-X** metric is defined as the average log-likelihood of these pseudo-label predictions:
   \[
   \text{TRANSFORM-X} = \frac{1}{N_T} \sum_{j=1}^{N_T} \log p(\hat{y}_j \mid \mathbf{z}_j)
   \]
   where \(\hat{y}_j\) is the (pseudo) target label for the sample \(j\).

Below is a schematic illustration in pseudo-code:

```python
# Pseudo-code for TRANSFORM-X computation

# 1. Compute source-class prototypes
for each class c in source_classes:
    prototypes[c] = mean( f_theta(x) for x in source_data where label(x) = c )

# 2. Pass target samples through f_theta
z_list = [f_theta(x_T) for x_T in target_data]

# 3. For each target embedding z, compute log-likelihood wrt prototypes
transform_x_values = []
for z in z_list:
    # Calculate similarity-based distribution for each prototype
    p_c = [similarity(z, prototypes[c]) for c in source_classes]
    # Normalize to form a probability distribution
    p_c_norm = softmax(p_c)
    # Append log probability of predicted class
    predicted_class = argmax(p_c_norm)
    transform_x_values.append( log(p_c_norm[predicted_class]) )

TRANSFORM_X = average(transform_x_values)
```
*This pseudo-code helps readers see the step-by-step process.*

## **4. Results and Conclusion**
*The **Results and Conclusion** section summarizes the empirical findings and the main takeaways from the work.*

We evaluate **TRANSFORM-X** on three major transfer learning benchmarks:

- **Image Classification** (ImageNet \(\to\) CIFAR-100)  
- **Text Classification** (IMDb \(\to\) Amazon Reviews)  
- **Time-Series Analysis** (Sensor-1 \(\to\) Sensor-2)

### **4.1 Quantitative Findings**
- **Correlation to True Performance**: **TRANSFORM-X** achieves a Pearson correlation of **0.85** with the final target accuracy across 10 different source models, surpassing previous metrics by **5% - 15%**.  
- **Runtime Efficiency**: Computing **TRANSFORM-X** requires only **2x** the cost of a single forward pass. No gradient backpropagation is performed on the target domain.

### **4.2 Discussion**
Our experiments confirm the viability of **TRANSFORM-X** as a simple and general tool to measure transferability. These findings demonstrate that:

1. **Shallow alignment** techniques are often sufficient to capture target domain readiness.  
2. **Avoiding fine-tuning** can still yield reliable transferability estimates, making it especially attractive for large-scale scenarios.
