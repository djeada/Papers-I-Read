## Tutorial on Variational Autoencoders

### Links

* https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05908v2.pdf

### Notes

* Gives very intuative explination of variational autoencoders. I particularly like Figure 4, it shows how to train the networks. I found reading this paper very slowly a few times to give me a much firmer understanding of variational autoencoders.
