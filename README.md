# Papers-I-Read

Welcome to **Papers-I-Read**, a personal repository dedicated to tracking and sharing scientific papers that I've read or plan to read. This collection spans various fields, including **Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Mathematics**. Here, you'll find links to the papers, my summaries, key takeaways, and personal reflections. 

The purpose of this repository is to serve as both a learning tool and a collaborative space for enthusiasts and professionals alike. By maintaining organized notes and summaries, I aim to deepen my understanding of complex topics and provide valuable resources for others interested in these subjects.
